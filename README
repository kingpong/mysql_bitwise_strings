mysql_bitwise_strings
========================================================================

This package provides sql functions for MySQL to perform bitwise
operations on strings of arbitrary length.  The functions are written in
C and are then loaded into the MySQL server as dynamic modules.  That
means you MUST INSTALL THIS ON THE MYSQL SERVER (not just from any
client).

These functions mimic the bitwise string operators in Perl. See
`perldoc perlop` for an explanation.

FUNCTIONS:

str_and(s1,s2,...)
  Performs a bitwise AND on the arguments and returns the result.
  The result is truncated to the length of the shortest operand.

str_or(s1,s2,...)
  Performs a bitwise OR on the arguments and returns the result.
  The result is truncated to the length of the longest operand.

str_xor(s1,s2,...)
  Performs a bitwise XOR on the arguments and returns the result.
  The result is truncated to the length of the longest operand.

str_not(s1)
  Performs a bitwise negation on the argument and returns the result.


INSTALLATION
========================================================================

The following commands must be run on the MySQL server.

Build the module:

  # make

Install the module into the library directory:

  # export DEST=/path/to/mysql/libs # optional
  # sudo make install-module

Install the functions into the running MySQL server:

  # make install-sql MYSQL_DATABASE=mydatabase

Run the test suite (requires Ruby, Ruby MySQL driver and Perl):

  # make test MYSQL_DATABASE=mydatabase \
              MYSQL_USER=myusername MYSQL_PASS=mypassword
